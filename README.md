This repo contains PowerShell samples that I demonstrated at the DC Continous Delivery meetup on July 29th.

These samples are for educational use, please don't just copy and paste them into production!

In order to get the scripts to run, it is assumed that you are running them from an AWS EC2 instance that has the appropriate IAM role with appropriate policies attached:  AmazonEC2FullAccess and IAMFullAccess
